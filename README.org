* Pro tip

Use as few as ZFS features as possible, as they are a source of bugs
and kernel panics.  Always create ZFS pools with all features
disabled, that is, =zpool create -o compatibility=legacy = flag.

Do not enable any ZFS feature unless absolutely necessary.  Prefer
LUKS over ZFS native encryption.
